    <h3>What is Data Structure?</h3>
    <h4> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. </h4>
    <br>
    <h3>There are 2 ways of looking at Data Structure:-</h3>
    <h4>1. Mathematical/Logical/Abstract Models/Views</h4>
    <h4>2. Implementation</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>What is Abstract Data Type?</h3>
    <h4>ADTs are entities that are definitions of data and operations but do not have implementation details.</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>What is an Algorithm?</h3>
    <h4>Dictionary Definition: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations,
    especially by a computer. <br>
    Formal Dictionary: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that are carried in a specific order to perform specific task.
    </h4>
    <h3>Some typical characteristics of algortihms:-</h3>
    <h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Inputs: 0 or more input values.</li>
            <li>Outputs: 1 or more than 1 output.</li>
            <li>Unambiguity: Clear and simple instructions.</li>
            <li>Finiteness: Limited number of instructions.</li>
            <li>Effectiveness: Each instruction has an impact on the overall process.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>What is Stack Data Structure?</h3>
    <h4>Stack is a linear data structure which operates in a LIFO(Last In First Out) <br> or FILO(First In Last Out) pattern.</h4>
    <h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, <br> for example- a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.</li><br>
            <li>Stack is an abstract data type with a bounded(predefined) capacity.</li><br>
            <li>It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a particular order.</li><br>
            <li>The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Standard Stack Operations:-</h3>
        <ol type="1">
          <h3><li>push() - </li></h3>
          <h4>Place an item onto the stack. If there is no place for new item, stack is in <u style="color: red;">overflow state</u>.</h4> 
          <h3><li>pop()</li></h3>
          <h4>Return the item at the top of the stack and then remove it. <br>
           If pop is called when stack is empty, it is in <u style="color: red;">underflow state </u>.
        </h4>
          <h3><li>isEmpty()</li></h3>
          <h4>Tells if the stack is empty or not.</h4> 
          <h3><li>isfull()</li></h3>
          <h4>Tells if the stack is full or not.</h4> 
          <h3><li>peek()</li></h3> 
          <h4>Access the item at the 'i' position.</h4>
          <h3><li>count()</li></h3>
          <h4>Get the number of items in the stack.</h4> 
          <h3><li>change()</li></h3> 
          <h4>Change the item at the 'i' position.</h4>
          <h3><li>display()</li></h3>
          <h4>Display all items in the stack.</h4> 
        </ol>

        <h3>Some Applications of Stack Data Structure:-</h3>
        <h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Balancing of symbols.</li>
                <li>Infix to Postfix/Prefix conversion.</li>
                <li>Redo-undo features at many places like editors, photoshop.</li>
                <li>Forward and backward feature in web browsers.</li>
                <li>Used in many algorithms like Tower of Hanoi, tree traversals, stock span problem, histogram problem.</li>
                <li>Other applications can be Backtracking, Knight tour problem, rat in a maze, N queen problem and sudoku solver.</li>
                <li>In Graph Algorithms like Topological Sorting and Strongly Connected Components.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>What is Queue Data Structure?</h3>
        <h4>Queue is a linear data structure which operates in a First In First Out or Last In Last Out.</h4>

        <h4>
            <ul>
                <li>It is named queue as it behaves like a real-world queue, for example - queue(line) of cars in a single lane, queue of people waiting at food counter, etc.</li>
                <li>Queue is an abstract data type with a bounded(predefined) capacity.</li>
                <li>It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a particular order.</li>
                <li>The order is FIFO(First In First Out) or LILO(Last In Last Out).</li>
            </ul>
        </h4>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> Standard Queue Operations:- </h3>

        <h4>
            <ol type="1">
               <li>enqueue() - Elements are added from one end (Rear / Back)</li>
               <li>dequeue() - Elements are removed from one end (Head / Front) </li>
               <li>isFull() - Check if queue is full</li>
               <li>isEmpty() - Check if queue is empty</li>
               <li>count() - gets count of total items in queue</li>
            </ol>

       <h3>Some Applications of Queue Data Structure</h3>

       <h4>Queue is used when things have to be processed in First In First Out order like - </h4>

       <h4>
           <ul>
               <li>CPU Scheduling, Disk Scheduling</li>
               <li>Handling of interrupts in real-time systems. The interrupts are handled in the same order as they arrive, first come first served.</li>
               <li>In real life, Call Center phone systems will use Queues to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free.</li>
               <li>When data is transferred asynchronously between two processes. Queue is used for synchronization.</li>
           </ul>
