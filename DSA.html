    <h3>What is Data Structure?</h3>
    <h4> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. </h4>
    <br>
    <h3>There are 2 ways of looking at Data Structure:-</h3>
    <h4>1. Mathematical/Logical/Abstract Models/Views</h4>
    <h4>2. Implementation</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>What is Abstract Data Type?</h3>
    <h4>ADTs are entities that are definitions of data and operations but do not have implementation details.</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>What is an Algorithm?</h3>
    <h4>Dictionary Definition: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations,
    especially by a computer. <br>
    Formal Dictionary: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that are carried in a specific order to perform specific task.
    </h4>
    <h3>Some typical characteristics of algortihms:-</h3>
    <h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Inputs: 0 or more input values.</li>
            <li>Outputs: 1 or more than 1 output.</li>
            <li>Unambiguity: Clear and simple instructions.</li>
            <li>Finiteness: Limited number of instructions.</li>
            <li>Effectiveness: Each instruction has an impact on the overall process.</li>
        </ul>
